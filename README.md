# Predicting Strokes Before They Happen
With this dataset, I hope to identify common factors among stroke victims, and identify if there are any key variables that could predict a stroke.
I was interested in choosing this dataset due to my interest in the brain and how it works. 
I think it's interesting how certain life choices that are seemingly harmless can have dire health consequences later in life.
I want to identify if the life and health habits among stroke victims are similar, and if they differ considerably from non stroke victims.
There are many parameters provided for each patient, and there are a lot of different ways these parameters can fit together 
to create a dashboard that correctly portrays this dataset.
# The Data
### **Who** 
The dataset was posted to kaggle.com from a user by the name of fedesoriano who claims that the data source is confidential due to the personal information being shared. There is little information on this user other than they are from Madrid, Spain.

### **What**
Our dataset includes a set of patients accompanied by the following data: 
- Patient ID
- Gender
- Age
- Hypertension status
- Heart disease status
- Marriage status 
- Type of employment
- Residence type
- Glucose level
- BMI
- Smoking status
- Whether they had a stroke 

### **When** 
Again, the creator provided little information of when the data was collected. The post on kaggle states that the dataset set was last updated roughly 2 years ago. The creatorâ€™s account was also created around 2 years ago, so it is likely the data was posted sometime in 2020.

### **Why** 
The dataset is used to see how likely someone is to have a stroke based on certain parameters. The author states that the dataset is intended for educational purposes.

### **How**  
There is no information on how the data was collected because of the confidentiality of the data

### **Limits**  
Due to the confidential nature of the data, it is impossible to tell where, when, or how the data was collected. This poses a challenge in verifying the legitimacy of said data. We will have to consider this legitimacy issue when coming to conclusions on the data.
